A “design document” for your project in the form of a Markdown file called DESIGN.md that discusses, technically, how you implemented your project and why you made the design decisions you did. Your design document should be at least several paragraphs in length. Whereas your documentation is meant to be a user’s manual, consider your design document your opportunity to give the staff a technical tour of your project underneath its hood.

Our website's main purpose is to use data from the surveys mentees and mentors take, and then match mentees and mentors based on this data. For simplicity and due to the time restrictions, we chose to keep our survey multiple choice to keep our matching algorithm concise, but also tried to keep our users in mind in designing the survey.
